Lumni App
=============

Lumni was created as a social media app to help graduates stay in touch by making it easier for them to plan events through communication tools such as chat, text messaging and links to other social media applications. They can also be updated with the latest industry news via an RSS feed, find out the weather and location through APIâ€™s and access information and photos from past and future events.
